## Overview

This Julia package
[(BlochSim.jl)](https://github.com/StevenWhitaker/BlochSim.jl)
provides functionality for simulating MRI pulse sequences.

See the
[README](https://github.com/StevenWhitaker/BlochSim.jl)
and
the "Examples" for details.
In particular,
the following blog posts
cover the basics of the Bloch equations
and some examples of how to use this package.
